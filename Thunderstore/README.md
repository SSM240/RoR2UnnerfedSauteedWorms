# UnnerfedSauteedWorms

Did you know that [Sautéed Worms](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/wiki/Saut%C3%A9ed_Worms) has a bunch of hidden nerfs to its stats that no other proc item does?
- 1 second cooldown between procs
- proc chance reduced the more active worms you have
- limit of 8 worms active at once

Well NO MORE! We're throwing all that "game balance" shit out the window! No more hidden limits, **just a raw 10% chance, every time!** Even more if you have clovers! What could possibly go wrong?

(Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any GPU fires that this may or may not cause.)

... oh, and I guess there's also some config to make it less ridiculous, if that's your thing.

I have no idea if this is host-only, so I'll stay on the safe side and say **everyone should have the mod, with the same config.**

As always, if anything is broken, ping me on Discord (`ssm24`) or open an issue on GitHub. Otherwise, enjoy :D
